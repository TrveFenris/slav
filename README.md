## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn` or `yarn install`

Fetches all required dependencies and saves them on a `node_modules` folder.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser (the script will automatically try to open your browser and redirect you to the mentioned URL).

The page will reload if you make code edits.

You will also see any errors and warnings in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner.

### `yarn test:cov`

Launches the test runner, collecting coverage information (which will be outputted on a `coverage` folder).

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production and outputs the result on a `dist` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for performance.

### `yarn check-types`

Runs the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) with the `noEmit` option. This will typecheck the codebase and throw errors in the console if there are any (without producing any compiled output).

### `yarn check-format`

Runs Prettier with the `check` option which will output if the code is properly formatted based on default rules (feel free to add a `.prettierrc` file on the main project folder to [customize formatting rules](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html)).

### `yarn format`

Runs Prettier with the `write` option which will apply formatting to the codebase based on default rules (feel free to add a `.prettierrc` file on the main project folder to [customize formatting rules](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html)).
